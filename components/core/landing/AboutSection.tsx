          I Worked as a Junior Developer at MIT Programmer, developing
          client solutions and a full-stack CRM with complete data flow. I then
          completed Techloset&apos;s 4-month Full-Stack &amp; Agentic AI Bootcamp,
          focused on full-stack and AI product development with modern
          frameworks and production workflows.

          I care about the full picture: clean architecture, strong UX, reliable
          backend flows, and AI that solves real product problems.

          If you&apos;re building something worth building or just want to talk
          tech, AI, or ideas, I&apos;d genuinely love to connect.
